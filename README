 SEMT - Compile-time symbolic differentiation via C++ templates
============================================================================

The SEMT library provides an easy way to define arbitrary functions
and obtain their derivatives via C++ expression templates.

This is a comprehensive extension of Zvi Guttermans original work
accompanying his Ph.D. thesis
"Symbolic Pre-computation for Numerical Applications",
see http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ssdl/thesis/finished/2004/ZviGutterman/.

Because of this origin, all code is free, see the LICENSE
file for details.

Usage
---------
Run
    make doc
to create the documentation with doxygen.

There are several example programs:

    * examples/semt_examples.cpp
            These are used in the documentation.

    * examples/semt_speed.cpp
            A test run on a mapping R^10 -> R^10.

    * semt_jacobian
            Implementation of Newton's method.

    * semt_check
            Some crude tests.

You can run
    make [release | gprof | gcov] <binary>
to compile a corresponding binary.
Using "release" mode enables compiler optimizations and places the
binary in the ./Release folder.
Using "gprof" creates a call graph and it's timings in
./gprof/<binary>_<arguments>,
where you can supply arguments via the ${ARGS} make variable.
Using "gcov" outputs coverage results into ./gcov.
